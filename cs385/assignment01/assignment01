I think that even basic graph theory problems are quite interesting. I was surprised to find that the Eulerian Path problem, where Euler tries to find a path that traverses each bridge in KÃ¶nigsberg exactly once, is not NP-complete, while the Hamiltonian Cycle problem is. According to the source I found, a poet in East Prussia named Rudrata had thought up a Hamiltonian Cycle problem over a million years ago. He was trying to find a path that a knight could take on a chessboard to land on each square exactly once, called the Knight's Tour problem. Hamilton later discovered the Hamiltonian Cycle problem in the 19th century.
The Hamiltonian Cycle problem is to find a path through a graph that touches each node exactly once. It is similiar to the Eulerian Path problem except that it uses node traversals instead of edge traversals as problem criteria. The Hamiltonian Cycle problem is basically the traveling salesman problem without specifying any weights for edge traversals. Solutions to these problems have real world applications in areas such as the logistics of delivering packages, finding routes for cars, and finding trips for airlines.
